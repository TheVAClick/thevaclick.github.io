Welcome to TheVA.Click, a place where Virtual Assistants and businesses looking for VAs can learn a thing or 2.  
My journey working from home started in 2007 first as a web developer and later transitioning to virtual assistance in 2014, working for various companies in the golfing industry, suppliers of kitchen appliances and event organizers.  
I did various tasks like research, data entry, website content creation, web design, social media management, customer support, order management, social media management, etc.

# Why TheVA.Click?

My wonderful wife and I got married in April 2024 and live as a interabled couple in a city near the Croatian border in Bosnia and Hercegovina.  
Being diagnosed with cerebral palsy right after birth and relying on a wheelchair my wife needs a personal assistant 24/7 for all the basic tasks.  
At the moment I am a stay-at-home husband working remotely full time for a Austrian call center doing customer support and order management.  
We want to teach people who for some reason need more time for themselves, their family or just start working at their own pace how to start as a VA.  
In the near future I want to have the freedom to dedicate more time to my wife and building our family, have a financial freedom to adapt our home and car for a wheelchair user.

# What to expect?

You will learn how easy it actually is to start as a VA even if you have ZERO experience. We will show you how to write an amazing CV in 2025 every employer would love to read. In a long term case study we will analyze major website where you can land your first VA job and show you our results at the end of the month doing only "simple" VA tasks.
